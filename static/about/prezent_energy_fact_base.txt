Prezent.Energy — Fact Base
==========================
Last updated: 2026-02-28

## Company Overview

Prezent.Energy is a technology firm delivering ubiquitous, accessible EV charging through an
"infrastructure-lite" on-demand model. Instead of requiring vehicles to find a charger, the company
sends autonomous VoltBot robots directly to parked vehicles. Primary market segments:

  - City Vehicle Fleets
  - Business Campuses / Workplaces
  - Residential Complexes / Multi-Unit Dwellings (MUDs)
  - Hotels / Hospitality

## Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) Model

Clients launch professional EV charging in as little as one week with zero capital expenditure —
no electrical work, no permitting, no fixed infrastructure.

Comparison vs. traditional fixed chargers:
  - Old way: $50,000–$500,000 per station, 6–12 month installation
  - Prezent way: $0 upfront, 1-week launch, 100% lot coverage

Employee productivity recovered: 90–130 hours per year by eliminating the "charging shuffle."

Market context: 36% of Americans in multi-unit housing currently lack access to EV charging.

Thermal management: Active cooling protocols monitor battery temperature in real time and
throttle charge rate to stay within OEM safe-charge envelopes. No thermal runaway risk.

## Operational Workflow (4-Step Autonomous Journey)

  1. BOOK        — Employees or fleet managers schedule morning/evening slots via mobile app.
  2. CHARGE      — VoltBot navigates autonomously to the vehicle's GPS coordinates and delivers
                   fast charging with no user effort.
  3. REPORT      — Real-time dashboard shows usage, satisfaction scores, and carbon reduction.
  4. GRID SUPPORT — Connected units participate in Virtual Power Plant (VPP) networks to
                   stabilize the grid during peak loads.

## Virtual Power Plant (VPP) & V2X

A VPP is an intelligent network linking EVs, solar panels, and batteries to act as a single
distributed power plant.

  V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid): Power sent from EV battery back to the utility grid for stability.
  V2H (Vehicle-to-Home): EV powers a home during peak rates or outages.
  V2L (Vehicle-to-Load): EV powers specific tools or appliances.

Governing standards: ISO 15118-20 (communication), UL 9741 (safety).
V2G hardware is compliant in the 2025+ VoltBot fleet; revenue sharing is live for compatible vehicles.

Financial benefit: V2G participants earn $800–$1,200 per vehicle per year in grid support revenue.

Strategic goal: By 2029, Prezent.Energy aims to operate as a full energy company using VoltBots
as hubs for solar-to-home-to-grid transitions, displacing nighttime utility energy use.

## V2X Roadmap

  2025  V2G pilot — 500 vehicles across Silicon Valley campuses
  2026  Full VPP integration with PG&E and SCE
  2027  National rollout — 10,000-vehicle fleet; VTH/G Bi-directional Smart Meter Adapters launch
  2029  Full energy company status with grid-scale VPP operations
